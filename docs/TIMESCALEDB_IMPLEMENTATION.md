# TimescaleDB Integration: Engineering Implementation Document

## 1. Introduction

This document provides detailed technical specifications and implementation guidance for integrating TimescaleDB with the DB-MCP-Server. It outlines the architecture, code structures, and specific tasks required to implement the features described in the PRD document.

## 2. Technical Background

### 2.1 TimescaleDB Overview

TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series database built as an extension to PostgreSQL. It provides:

- Automatic partitioning of time-series data ("chunks") for better query performance
- Retention policies for automatic data management
- Compression features for efficient storage
- Continuous aggregates for optimized analytics
- Advanced time-series functions and operators
- Full SQL compatibility with PostgreSQL

TimescaleDB operates as a transparent extension to PostgreSQL, meaning existing PostgreSQL applications can use TimescaleDB with minimal modifications.

### 2.2 Current Architecture

The DB-MCP-Server currently supports multiple database types through a common interface in the `pkg/db` package. PostgreSQL support is already implemented, which provides a foundation for TimescaleDB integration (as TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension).

Key components in the existing architecture:

- `pkg/db/db.go`: Core database interface and implementations
- `Config` struct: Database configuration parameters
- Database connection management
- Query execution functions
- Multi-database support through configuration

## 3. Architecture Changes

### 3.1 Component Additions

New components to be added:

1. **TimescaleDB Connection Manager**
   - Extended PostgreSQL connection with TimescaleDB-specific configuration options
   - Support for hypertable management and time-series operations

2. **Hypertable Management Tools**
   - Tools for creating and managing hypertables
   - Functions for configuring chunks, dimensions, and compression

3. **Time-Series Query Utilities**
   - Functions for building and executing time-series queries
   - Support for time bucket operations and continuous aggregates

4. **Context Provider**
   - Enhanced information about TimescaleDB objects for user code context
   - Schema awareness for hypertables

### 3.2 Integration Points

The TimescaleDB integration will hook into the existing system at these points:

1. **Configuration System**
   - Extend the database configuration to include TimescaleDB-specific options
   - Add support for chunk time intervals, retention policies, and compression settings

2. **Database Connection Management**
   - Extend the PostgreSQL connection to detect and utilize TimescaleDB features
   - Register TimescaleDB-specific connection parameters

3. **Tool Registry**
   - Register new tools for TimescaleDB operations
   - Add TimescaleDB-specific functionality to existing PostgreSQL tools

4. **Context Engine**
   - Add TimescaleDB-specific context information to editor context
   - Provide hypertable schema information

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Configuration Extensions

Extend the existing `Config` struct in `pkg/db/db.go` to include TimescaleDB-specific options:

### 4.2 Connection Management

Create a new package `pkg/db/timescale` with TimescaleDB-specific connection management:

### 4.3 Hypertable Management

Create a new file `pkg/db/timescale/hypertable.go` for hypertable management:

### 4.4 Time-Series Query Functions

Create a new file `pkg/db/timescale/query.go` for time-series query utilities:

### 4.5 Tool Registration

Extend the tool registry in `internal/delivery/mcp` to add TimescaleDB-specific tools:

### 4.6 Editor Context Integration

Extend the editor context provider to include TimescaleDB-specific information:
